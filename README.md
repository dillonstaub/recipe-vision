# recipe-vision
A project using computer vision techniques to recognize written and typed recipes 

This problem is challenging due to the varied nature of recipe formats. For typed recipes, optical character recognition (OCR) techniques have achieved oustanding results on standard fonts; however, written characters pose a more difficult challenge. 

The EMNIST data set was used for handwritten character classification: Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373
